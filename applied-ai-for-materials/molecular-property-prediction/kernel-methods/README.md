# Kernel-Based Molecular Machine Learning

Kernel-based machine learning models are among the most important in molecular machine learning. 
These notebooks introduce the theory and methods behind them.

## Key Concepts

Through completing these modules, you should be able to:

- [ ] Use both [DScribe](https://singroup.github.io/dscribe/latest/) and [QML](http://www.qmlcode.org/) to fit a kernel learning model.
- [ ] Know which hyperparameters of KRR to tune and how
- [ ] Understand the benefits of scalable kernels and the limitations around training set size vs computational cost.
