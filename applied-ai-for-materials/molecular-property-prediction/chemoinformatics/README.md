# Chemoinformatics

The notebooks here introduce a few key concepts in [chemoinformatics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci600234z) and 
one of its subdiscplines, [Quantitative-Structure Activity Relationships (QSAR)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/cr200066h).

## Key Concepts

Through completing these modules, you should be able to:

- [ ] Manipulate a dataset of molecules using RDKit
- [ ] Compute chemical descriptors and molecular fingerprints
- [ ] Train a descriptor machine learning model using a common "reduce then fit" pattern
- [ ] Train a fingerprint-based machine learning model using a KNN model.
